var text = "When I retire from boxing, I really don't know. I wanna say something right here, this might make you all think. Life is real short, so you add up all your  " +
"traveling, all your sleeping, your school, your entertainment, you probably been half your life doing nothing. I am now 35 years old; 30 more years I'll be  " +
"65. We don't have no more influence, we can't do nothing much at 65, your wife will tell you that. When you're 65, ain't too much more to do. Did you know  " +
"I will be 65 in 30 years? In those 30 years, I have to sleep 9 years, I don't have 30 years of daylight, I have to travel back to America which takes 6-7  " +
"hours. With all my traveling, that will be probably 4 years of traveling in the next 30 years. About 9 years of sleeping, television, movies, and about 3  " +
"years of entertainment. So, out of 30 years I might have about 16 years to be productive; so this is how we can all break down our individual lives. What  " +
"I am going to do in the next 16 years, what is the best thing I can do? " +
"Get ready to meet God. Going into real estate, going into business, teaching boxers, that won't get me to heaven. Now, let me ask this audience a question. " +
"How many believe there is a supreme being? How many believe there's a God? How many believe there's some power that made the sun, the moon, the stars? How  " +
"many believe that this stuff didn't just come out here? Somebody wiser than us made it. How many believe there's a God? How many believe there's not a God? " +
"Alright, if I told you, you who don't believe in God, if I told you that this glass sprung into existence, would you believe it? That this glass made  " +
"itself, no man made this glass, would you believe it? Would you believe if I just told you this thing made itself? No, no. You wouldn't believe it, right?  " +
"If I told you this television station popped into existence, no man made it, you would say that Muhammad Ali is crazy. Alright, well, this glass can't  " +
"make itself. If I told you that the clothes you have on wove themselves, that nobody created them, those clothes made themselves, you wouldn't believe it.  " +
"But if your clothes didn't make itself, if that glass couldn't make itself, if this building didn't make itself, then how did the moon get out there? How  " +
"did the stars and Jupiter, Neptune and Mars, and the Sun get out there? How did all this come here if a wise planner didn't make it? " +
"So what I'm saying is I believe we're going to be judged. Should a man like Hitler kill the Jews and get away with it? Somebody should punish him. Maybe  " +
"he don't get it now, he get it when he die. In hell for eternity. So what I'm gonna do when I get out of boxing, is to get myself reading to meet God  " +
"because ……………….it's a scary thing to think that I'm going to hell to burn eternally forever. So what am I gonna do? The reason why I'm taking such a long  " +
"time to answer your question is that I'm explaining what you asked in the question. You asked me a question; I can't just answer it like that. When I get  " +
"out of boxing or when I'm through, I'm gonna do all I can to help people. Here's a poor man come all the way to America. There's a bunch of boys need some  " +
"money and somebody is calling me to help them. God is watching me. God don't praise me because I beat Joe Frazier. God don't give nothing about Joe Frazier " +
". God don't care nothing about England or America as far as we aware of. He wants to know how do we treat each other, how do we help each other. So I'm  " +
"going to dedicate my life to using my name and popularity to helping charities, helping people, uniting people…..we need somebody in the world to help us  " +
"all make peace. So when I die, if there's a heaven, I want to see it. The odds are everybody in this room, some of you gonna be dead 20 years from now,  " +
"some of you gonna be dead 50 years from now. Some of you gonna be dead 30, some of you gonna be 60, 70 years from now. We all gonna die soon and if you  " +
"live to be say 125 years old, which we don't do, we don't have but about 80 years on earth. This is a test to see where we will spend our life, heaven or  " +
"hell; this is not the life now. Your real self is inside you, because your body gets old. Some of you go to look at the mirror and you don't have teeth,  " +
"your hair is leaving you, and your bodies are getting tired. But your soul and your spirit never die, that's gonna live forever. So your body is just  " +
"housing your soul and spirit. So God is testing us on how we treat each other and how we live to see where our real home will be in heaven. So this  " +
"physical stuff don't last for so long. So my car, this building is gonna be here when the man who built is dead. There have been many kings and queens of  " +
"England, they all dead. After this one is gone another one comes. So we don't stay here; we're just trustees. We don't own nothing. Even your children are  " +
"not yours. If you think I'm lying, your wife is not yours. You don't own your children and you don't own your family. So what am I saying? The most  " +
"important thing is what's gonna happen when you die. Are you going to heaven or hell? And that's eternity! How long is eternity?? Let's imagine. Take the  " +
"Sahara Desert. There's a lot of sand on the Sahara Desert, right? Then imagine that one grain of sand represents 1000 years. And when you in hell burning,  " +
"when you die and go to hell, you gonna burn forever and ever and ever. No end. How long is that? To give you an idea of how long eternity is, take the  " +
"Sahara Desert and I told you to wait 1000 years and every 1000 years I want you to pick up a grain of sand until the desert is empty. Ok, wait 1000 years-- " +
"pick up a grain, wait another 1000 years before you get the next grain, keep that up until there's no more sand in the desert. I mean, America is not but  " +
"200 years old. We got 800 more years before 1000 so just scares me to think that I'm gonna die one day and go to hell. …………..so what am I gonna do when  " +
"I'm through fighting? I only have 16 years to be productive and get myself ready to meet God and go to the best place. Does that make sense? " 
 

var text = "I once tried to sell a brand-new, still-in-the-box iPhone 4 for $300. " +
"The first response I received was from a teenager who tried to convince me that I should drive for  " +
"more than two hours so that he could look at it before deciding whether or not to buy. When I answered that I  " +
"was unwilling to travel that much unless he was actually going to purchase the device, he threatened to buy a video game console  " +
"instead. I'm not entirely sure what he was hoping to achieve with that, but I wished him the best of luck and hung up. " +
"My second inquiry came from a girl who wanted to exchange sexual favors for the smartphone. (Keep in mind, this young woman  " +
"had never even seen what I looked like.) When I politely declined, she sent me several pictures of herself, then reiterated the  " +
"offer. After I declined again, she offered some choice words about both my sexuality and what she assumed to be my preferred method of  " +
"consuming enough protein.  Respondents three, four, and five all asked if I would trade for older (and presumably used) devices, and  " +
"respondent six tried to make the case for why I was a horrible human being if I didn't just give it to her. According to her sob story, she  " +
"had purchased a different smartphone on Craigslist some two or three weeks prior, only to have it stolen. By not offering her the one I was trying  " +
"to sell, I was apparently just as bad as that thief.  The fellow I ultimately did sell to insisted that we meet at a service center  " +
"so that he could confirm that I hadn't stolen the item in question. I was happy to oblige by that point. He paid cash, and the entire transaction was  " +
"over with in under fifteen minutes. That was, he said to me, much easier than I expected. I just smiled and thanked him. "



var text = "A cool, young couple bought a bread maker from me and my husband. They came over to get it and our baby is screaming, the dogs  " +
"barking, and our 4 year old is running around like a wild hose. I'm old and this couple was totally hip and almost half my age. They  " +
"ask a lot of questions about baking bread. They seem oblivious to the chaos around them. I'm in awe of their coolness and attempt to sound  " +
"intelligible. The next day the man texts my husband pics of the yummy bread they made. Then he invites us to their game night. I still dream of  " +
"attending their magical game night. "

"Seriously if you are a single guy and you were hoping to get laid this summer, don’t even bother reading this ad. Driving this  " +

"The Bad: This car has a bunch of dents and cosmetic stuff going on. Someone side swiped me in a parking lot and just drove off without leaving a note. " +
"(btw if that was you and youre reading this you are a complete d bag. I wouldn’t have even called the cops dude but you could have bought me a case a beer to  " +
"drown out the soul crushing pain of having to drive this POS car to my awful job every day). I hit a deer last year and had to replace a headlight. Hitting a deer is terrifying,  " +
"seriously…I don’t think the deer liked it either.  Almost rust free but I noticed a small spot starting on the bottom of the drivers door about mid winter. I thought to myself I should do  " +
"something about that rust spot, then i didn’t do anything about the rust spot. That is pretty much how i tend to deal with adversity in my life. " +
"ABS wasnt working right so i had to disable it. Front end has a little noise to it when turning wheel all the way. Garage told me it was a bushing thing. I asked if  " +
"it was dangerous to drive for the next six months and they said it shouldn’t be a big deal. The gas gauge is like a drunk girl on her period, confusing, and mostly useless. " +

"(that is not an implied guarantee this automobile is not cursed, just that if such as curse exists I am unaware of it) Sounds like it wouldn’t be a " +

"have to go to the junk yard for parts. Pain in the ass.  It does get good gas mileage with the little 2.2l four banger. Lots of parts have been replaced on this car. " +
"Just before winter it got new plugs, wires, pcv, fuel filter, air filter, battery, and muffler. Computer was replaced last year, as was a tie rod and brakes. " +
"Water pump two yrs ago. All these should outlast the car " +
"The Good and Bad: This car has no stereo. Now wait, before you go on amazon and buy a cheap 20$ unit so you can listen to Pandora think of this as an opportunity. Can you play the harmonica? " +
"I BET YOU CAN”T. But this is your big chance to become a pro at the mouth organ. What is the biggest obstacle to getting all bodacious like Mr. John Popper? Until you can learn to play correctly  " +
